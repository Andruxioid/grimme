  "description": "Today was a bad day. I saw how brother left us. They took him and went down the road. Those left are only me and mother. Every day I hear her cries. It's been nearly a week since they took father. The skies go grim dark. I hear them every night. Roars that don't let me sleep. I can't sleep. My mother doesn't sleep as well. I want it to end."
